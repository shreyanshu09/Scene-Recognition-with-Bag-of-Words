# Scene-Recognition-with-Bag-of-Words

The goal of this project is to solve the classical computer vision topic, Scene Recognition with Bag of Words. In particular, I examine the task of scene recognition beginning with simplest method, tiny images and KNN(K nearest neighbor) classification, and then move forward to the state-of-the-art techniques, bags of quantized local features and linear classifiers learned by SVC(support vector classifier).
